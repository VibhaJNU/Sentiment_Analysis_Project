📝 File Descriptions
Filename	Purpose
eda.py	Contains text preprocessing functions: preprocess_text, remove_most_frequent_words, vectorize_text.
fast_api.py	Implements FastAPI app (/predict) for sentiment inference using the saved model and vectorizer.
vectorizer.pkl	Serialized CountVectorizer used for transforming text.
naive_bayes_model.pkl	Trained Naive Bayes model used to predict sentiment.
requirements.txt	Lists dependencies to run preprocessing, model training, and the API.

🚀 Getting Started
1. Install Dependencies
Activate your virtual environment and run:
pip install -r src/requirements.txt

Save naive_bayes_model.pkl and vectorizer.pkl in src/

3. Start the API Server
Navigate to your project root, then run:

uvicorn src.fast_api:app --reload --port 8080
Access the API at http://127.0.0.1:8080

Interactive docs available at http://127.0.0.1:8080/docs

⚙️ Usage
✅ Predicting Sentiment via HTTP POST request:
Endpoint: POST /predict

Payload:
{
  "user_review": "I loved the movie!"
}
Response:
{
  "review": "I loved the movie!",
  "prediction": "Positive"
}
🧩 How It Works
Text Preprocessing

Lowercasing, URL removal, punctuation cleanup

Stopword removal and lemmatization

Filtering out the most frequent words

Vectorization

Uses loaded CountVectorizer from vectorizer.pkl

Prediction

Applies the Naive Bayes model to generate sentiment prediction

📚 Future Enhancements
Add support for predict_proba to return probabilities

Upgrade models: integrate TfidfVectorizer, SVM or Neural Networks

Dockerize the FastAPI + model artifacts for scalable deployment
